[Intel Dual Band Wireless AX200NGW - WiFi 6 AX200 WiFi Adapter - 2.4GHz 574Mbps/5GHz 2.4Gbps - 802.11AX Network Card - Bluetooth5.0 Wireless Network Adapter For Windows 10 64Bit/Google Chrome OS/Linux ](https://www.amazon.com/Intel-Dual-Band-Wireless-AX200NGW/dp/B07V9N9XVJ/ref=sr_1_4?crid=2L8T86SQVRCA1&keywords=ax200+wifi+card&qid=1681179252&sprefix=ax200%2Caps%2C321&sr=8-4)

This card when installed in HP Notebook 14-dq1033cl with Ubuntu 22.04 would connect to Wi-fi, and BT just fine upon cold boot. But whenever the laptop suspended (due to inactivity or a closed lid) and resumed, it would automatically go into "Hardware Airplane mode". The key strokes Fn+F12 (with the airplane icon on F12) could never get it out of it. This key combination would work just fine for normal "Airplane Mode" before the laptop ever went to suspend though. There is no Hardware Airplane switch on this laptop to mechanically turn off that mode like I see in various forums for other laptops. The only option to switch off from "Hardware Airplane mode" and resume any kind of connectivity was to reboot the laptop, which was obviously the worst option. Any changes to several settings (key maps, gnome-tweaks, kernel parameters in grub) never helped. In fact they introduced new issues with Touchpad etc. The earlier Wi-fi card on this laptop was RTL8822CE, which never had this issue. When the AX200 worked (before ever suspending and resuming), it did seems like a great card. Just  wish this "Hardware Airplane mode" issue wasn't there to make it a **show stopper**.
